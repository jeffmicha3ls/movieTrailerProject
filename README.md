## Movie Trailer website

This server-side code stores a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery,
a small synopsis, actor list and a movie trailer URL.

### Usage

This is a simple website that is accessed by either cloning the repository or
downloading the zip file.  Once you have the files on your system, you can initiate
the movie reviews by clicking on the entertainment_center.py python file.  

Simply scroll to the desired movie and click within the highlighted movie block.

### Tools

This particular project was created with the **_Python_** editor, _IDLE_, as well as
the **_Atom_** text editor to modify the markdown in this _README_ file.

### Features

The following features are available within this Movie Trailer website:

1.  Movie title with **_Wikipedia_** box art.
2.  A link to the **_YouTube_** movie trailer.
3.  In addition, a small synopsis and actor list is available.
